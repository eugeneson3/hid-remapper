# HID Remapper

## Jarvis Feather nightly, 2026-09-06

This candidate starts directly at `cb0697468050e67e184e0df644d995f9aab2923e`.
It does not reuse the previous nightly/QMK experiments. Board: `feather_host`;
target: `remapper`. USB identity `046D:C52B`, config version 18 and commands
22/26/27/28 are retained. Command 30 carries `running:uint8, ttl_ms:uint16 LE`.
The Jarvis stable and nightly_v2 images are not promoted or replaced.

- Snapshot each physical report and injection command before the next event,
  including DOWN/UP arriving within one USB task. Tick-based macros keep their
  original 1ms duration accounting.
- Hold the 128-entry output FIFO head until TinyUSB's transfer-complete callback.
  Retry rejected submissions and failed completions. Remote wakeup is separate
  from delivery; check all queued/deferred reports and issue one accepted request
  per suspend interval. Monitor buffers are immutable while in flight.
- Retry HID receive submission in the main 1ms tick; cancel retries on detach
  and start PIO SOF only after host initialization. Apply the hash-checked TinyUSB
  patch so failed transfers cannot replay stale receive bytes.
- On keyboard USB-A detach, clear the departing interface ownership before
  freeing its index, then immediately queue the merged release. Other keyboards
  and injected keys remain held. Late callbacks are ignored. Repeated unmount
  callbacks from a composite device are harmless.
- Clear staging even on saturation. When a host stalls beyond finite capacity,
  keep the latest state per report and deliver it after the FIFO drains. This
  preserves eventual release, but cannot preserve unlimited keystrokes during a
  prolonged stall. The host receive side applies backpressure at 64 queued states.
- Preserve Pause / Tab+arrows monitor events `FFFC:0001..0004` and physical
  passthrough. Monitor now includes boot-array KEYUP events. D13 uses hardware PWM
  for auto-mode breathing, holds phase across heartbeats and turns off on OFF,
  TTL or USB unmount. OFF-mode 50ms pulses come only from new physical KEYDOWN.

```sh
git submodule update --init
python3 tools/patch-tinyusb.py
python3 tests/test_hid_reliability.py
cmake -S firmware -B firmware/build -DPICO_BOARD=feather_host -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build firmware/build --target remapper -j8
```

The host suite links the actual parser and mapping engine with AddressSanitizer
and UBSan, including 10,000 taps / 20,000 ordered states, 100 detach/reconnect
cycles, shared-key ownership, modifiers, NKRO and boot reports, truncation,
rollover, saturation, delivery acknowledgements, monitor buffers, receive retries,
shortcuts and LED timing. These tests mock USB/board functions. They do not prove
physical PC reception, application behavior or long-duration hardware stability.
Before promotion, test physical passthrough with Jarvis closed, injected
hold/release/clear, simultaneous inputs, USB-A detach while holding a modifier and
key, reconnect, sleep/resume, and at least two hours or 10,000 hardware taps with
zero stuck keys. Unplugging USB-C removes the channel needed to send KEYUP and is
a different scenario from the USB-A disconnect fixed here.

_For user documentation please see the project's website at [remapper.org](https://www.remapper.org/)._

This is a configurable USB dongle that allows you to remap inputs from mice, keyboards and other devices. It works completely in hardware and requires no software running on the computer during normal use.

It can do things like reassign buttons, change keyboard layouts, map mouse buttons to keyboard inputs, map keystrokes to mouse inputs, change mouse sensitivity (permanently or when a button is held), rotate mouse axes by arbitrary (non-90 degree) angles, drag-lock for mouse buttons, scroll by moving the mouse, and much more.

It is configurable [through a web browser](https://www.remapper.org/config/) using WebHID (Chrome or Chrome-based browser required).

Wireless receivers are supported and multiple devices can be connected at the same time using a USB hub (with different mappings for each device if desired).

In addition to the remapping functionality, it can do polling rate overclocking up to 1000 Hz.

A separate [serial](SERIAL.md) version of the remapper takes inputs from a serial (RS-232) mouse and translates them to USB.

There's also a [Bluetooth](BLUETOOTH.md) version that runs on nRF52840-based boards, which translates Bluetooth inputs to USB.

## How to make the device

There are three main ways of making the HID Remapper. You can either buy [this board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5723) from Adafruit, make it yourself using a Raspberry Pi Pico (or two), or you can use the provided files to manufacture a custom board at JLCPCB or a similar service. The functionality is the same in all cases.

If you get the Feather RP2040 USB Host board from Adafruit, the device is ready to use, you just need to flash it with the right firmware ([remapper\_feather.uf2](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper/releases/latest/download/remapper_feather.uf2)). Hold the "Boot" button on the board, then press the "Reset" button. A USB drive should show up on your computer. Copy the UF2 file to that drive. That's it.

See [here](HARDWARE.md) for details on how to make the Pico variants of the device and [here](custom-boards/) for details on the custom board option.

## How to use the configuration tool

A live version of the web configuration tool can be found at [remapper.org/config](https://www.remapper.org/config/).

For details on how to use it, please see the [HID Remapper Manual](https://www.remapper.org/manual/).

If you can't use the browser-based configuration tool, there's also a [command-line tool](config-tool) that takes JSON in the same format as the web tool on standard input. I only tested it on Linux, but in theory it should also run on Windows and Mac.

## How to update the firmware

The procedure to update the firmware is similar on all variants. When you go to the configuration website and try to connect to your device when it doesn't have the latest firmware, you will get a message and a link to a version of the configuration interface that is compatible with your current (old) firmware. Click that link, connect to your HID Remapper by clicking "Open device" as usual, then go to the "Actions" tab and click "Flash firmware". This will put your device in firmware flashing mode. A drive should appear on your computer. For all the RP2040-based variants, the drive will be named "RPI-RP2". For the Bluetooth variants, it will be called something else, depending on what board you're using. Download the correct firmware file for your variant (see table below) and copy it to that drive. On custom boards v1, v2, v5, v6 and v7 (dual RP2040 boards), after flashing the firmware you have to disconnect and reconnect your HID Remapper. That's it, you can go back to the regular version of the configuration interface and carry on.

_(Please note that previously a manual "Flash B side" step was required on custom boards v1, v2, v5, v6 and v7. That is no longer necessary.)_

If you're using the dual Pico variant then you need to flash the A side using the [remapper\_dual\_a.uf2](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper/releases/latest/download/remapper_dual_a.uf2) file as described above and then flash the B side manually. Disconnect your HID Remapper from your computer, disconnect the OTG adapter from the B-side Pico, hold the BOOTSEL button on the B-side Pico and then, while holding the button, connect the B-side Pico to your computer. A drive named "RPI-RP2" should appear. Copy the [remapper\_dual\_b.uf2](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper/releases/latest/download/remapper_dual_b.uf2) file to that drive. Disconnect the B-side Pico from your computer, reconnect the OTG adapter and reconnect your HID Remapper to your computer.

When updating firmware, the current configuration on your HID Remapper is preserved. For extra peace of mind you can export your configuration to a JSON file before performing the update. That way if you need to revert to the old version of the firmware for any reason, you'll be able to import the configuration from the JSON file (configuration is lost when going from a newer firmware to an older firmware).

## How to compile the firmware

The easiest way to compile the firmware is to let GitHub do it for you. This repository has GitHub Actions that build the firmware, so you can just fork, make your changes, wait for the job to complete, and look for the binaries in the artifacts produced.

To compile the RP2040 firmware on your machine, use the following steps (details may vary depending on your Linux distribution):

```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib srecord
git clone https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper.git
cd hid-remapper
git submodule update --init
cd firmware
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
# or, to build for the custom boards:
# PICO_BOARD=remapper cmake ..
make
```

To compile the nRF52 firmware, you can either follow [Nordic's setup instructions](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/installation.html) and then `west build -b seeed_xiao_nrf52840` to compile the firmware, or you can use Docker with a command like this (start from the top level of the repository or adjust the path accordingly):

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workdir/project -w /workdir/project/firmware-bluetooth nordicplayground/nrfconnect-sdk:v2.2-branch west build -b seeed_xiao_nrf52840
```
